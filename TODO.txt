1. In-place binary compute and in-place versions of array level functions like exp
2. SIMD for inner product (and some of the pointwise operations?)
    - SIMD for matrix multiplication is partially done, but maybe I want gather-load SIMD for non-contigous arrays
    - Definitely need SIMD for pointwise operations and reduce
3. Proper testing
4. More direct version of operator= for array
5. Use preprocessor check for data alignment for debug version and platforms that do not use Microsoft C Runtime Library
