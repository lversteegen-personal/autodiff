1. In-place binary compute and in-place versions of array level functions like exp
2. SIMD for inner product (and some of the pointwise operations?)
    - SIMD for matrix multiplication is partially done, but maybe I want gather-load SIMD for non-contigous arrays
    - SIMD for ptws operations also partially done, but non-SIMD base versions should also make use of memory localization
    - Still need SIMD for reduce
3. Proper testing
    - More extensive version of gradientTest()
4. More direct version of operator= for array and scalar
5. Use preprocessor check for data alignment for debug version and platforms that do not use Microsoft C Runtime Library
6. Give autodiff its own namespace, done
    - Make namespace level factory functions for unit creation
7. ADAM optimizer
